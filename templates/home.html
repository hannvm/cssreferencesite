    <h1>Welcome to my CSS Reference Site</h1>
    <p>I built this site as it felt like an excellent way to consolidate everything I've learned in CSS, and also create a reference for myself for the future.</p>
    <p>I also took the opportunity on what could potentially be a big project with a lot of repeated code to start learning to render templates with Flask. Check out the Flask tab for more info on how I did it.</p>
    <p><b>Please Note: </b>This site isn't responsive, so it won't work well on mobiles or smaller screens. To look at examples of responsive sites I have built, please check out my github.</p>
    <p>If you want to look at more things I've built, <a href="https://github.com/hannvm" target="blank">click here for my github</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-minshull-51a722159/" target="blank">here to get in touch on linkedin.</a> Thank you!</p>
